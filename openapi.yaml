        * If it is a sending registry, complete or terminate the action.<br><br>

        A registry proposes an action to the hub.  Once the hub validates the proposedAction, it is given an actionId (see Action schema).
        An action consists in the transfer of at least one ITMO from one account to another account, in the same or in a different registry.
        An authorisation/issuance/creation action must specify the same origin and destination account.
        All other transaction must specify different origin and destination accounts.
