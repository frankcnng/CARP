     <b>Introduction</b>
     <br><br>This API is part of the communication standards for transactions with
     Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) pursuant to decision 6/CMA.4, para. 32.
     <br><br>Participating Parties opting to apply the guidance referred to in 
     decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, chapter I.B are expected to adhere to this API when they interoperate.
     <br><br><b>Current status</b>
     <br><br>This API is currently limited to schama definitions for ITMOs.
