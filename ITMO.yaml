					type: string
					example: CA0002
				orginatingParty:
					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5) ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 identifier of the originating Party registry.
					type: string
					example: BEL
				firstTransferringParty:
					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5) ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 identifier of the first transferring Party.
					type: string
					example: FRA

					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5) year in which the mitigation outcome occurred.
					type: integer
					minimum: 2015
					maximum: 9999
					example: 2025
				serialFirst:
					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5) unique serial number of the first ITMO in the block.
					type: string
					example: CA0005-ART-GY-1-2021
				serialLast:
					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5) unique serial number of the last ITMO in the block.
					# Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.5 actually only requires a single unique identifier in ITMO identifier,
					# but as we consider all ITMOs as blocks, the last identifier of the block is required.
					type: string
					example: CA0005-ART-GY-7,144,362-2021
				mitigationOutcomeHashes:
					description: (required by Decision 6/CMA.4, annex I, para.4). ITMOs must be traceable to their mitigation outcomes.
									This array contains the SHA256 hashes of all mitigation outcome documents for this ITMO.
									The UNFCCC will store all MO documents, and provide an API getMitigationOutcomeDoc(serialFirst, serialLast, SHA256)
									that will return the URL of the MO document corresponding to the hash.
